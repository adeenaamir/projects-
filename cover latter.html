            <td>A cover letter is a document that you submit as part of your job application, alongside your resume or CV.

                The purpose of a cover letter is to introduce you and briefly summarize your professional background. On average, it should be around 250 to 400 words long.
                
                A good cover letter is supposed to impress the hiring manager and convince them you’re worth interviewing as a candidate.
                So, how can your cover letter achieve this?
                First of all, it should complement your resume, not copy it. Your cover letter is your chance to elaborate on important achievements, skills, or anything else that your resume doesn’t give you the space to cover. 
                For example, if you have an employment gap on your resume, the cover letter is a great place to explain why it happened and how it helped you grow as a person. 
                If this is your first time writing a cover letter, writing about yourself might seem complicated. But don’t worry—you don’t need to be super creative or even a good writer.
                All you have to do is follow this tried and tested cover letter structure:
                
                </td>
        </tr> 
        <tr>
            <td>my relative experience include the fo;;owing highlights</td>
        </tr> 
        <tr>
            <td>Header. Add all the necessary contact information at the top of your cover letter.
                Formal greeting. Choose an appropriate way to greet your target audience.
                Introduction. Introduce yourself in the opening paragraph and explain your interest in the role.
                </td>
        </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>On the other hand, if the job advertisement doesn’t require a cover letter from the candidates, adding one shows you went the extra mile.

                g in the effort to write a cover letter can set you apart from other candidates with similar professional experience and skills, and it could even sway the hiring manager to call you for an interview if you do it right.</td>
