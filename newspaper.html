            The case involves the arrest of key officials from the Dow University of Health Sciences (DUHS) and others for allegedly leaking the MDCAT (Medical and Dental Colleges Admission Test) question paper. These individuals, including Fuad Sheikh (Controller of Examinations), Manthar Ali (Deputy Controller of Examinations), and four others (Muhammad Farooque Khan, Tariq Aziz Samo, Shan Asfandyar, and Shiraz Bilal), were detained by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for their involvement in selling the exam paper via social media platforms in exchange for monetary compensation.he case involves the arrest of key officials from the Dow University of Health Sciences (DUHS) and others for allegedly leaking the MDCAT (Medical and Dental Colleges Admission Test) question paper.

This ruling comes as part of a broader scholarship fraud case that has raised questions about HEC’s processes.

            Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani issued a 12-page verdict, overturning a lower court’s decision that had ruled in favor of HEC’s recovery claim in this scholarship fraud case. The court highlighted flaws in HEC’s scholarship policy and provided critical guidelines to prevent similar incidents in the future.
            
            According to the judgment, PhD scholar Imran Taj applied for an overseas scholarship in 2005 and agreed to serve in Pakistan for four years after completing his studies. However, Taj failed to return after completing his PhD in France. Documents submitted as a guarantee by his guarantor, Abdul Waheed, were later proven to be forged in what became a scholarship fraud case.
            
            An FIA investigation confirmed discrepancies in the signatures on the guarantee documents. Abdul Waheed denied his involvement and declared the documents fraudulent. Based on these findings, the court ruled that HEC could not legally recover funds from the guarantor but could pursue criminal prosecution against Imran Taj for submitting fake documents in this scholarship fraud case.
            
            Key Recommendations for HEC:
            
            Guarantee documents should be registered with the district sub-registrar’s office.
            Guarantor and witness photographs should be included in the agreements for transparency.
            A complete record of scholars’ expenditures should be maintained.
            A dedicated dispute resolution unit should be established to handle such cases before escalating to court.

            The accused sought bail, which was initially opposed by the prosecutor, who argued that the case was still at an early stage, and the charge sheet had not been submitted. Despite this, the Judicial Magistrate (Malir), Piyar Ali Khoso, granted bail of Rs100,000 to each suspect after considering arguments from the defence counsel. The defence claimed that there was insufficient evidence to justify the charges, highlighting that the relevant sections of the law under PECA (Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act) were bailable offenses.

However, the magistrate had initially returned the bail applications, citing jurisdictional issues, particularly concerning the Prevention of Corruption Act, as some of the accused were public servants. The magistrate noted that misconduct by public servants was a scheduled offense under the Act. A sessions judge later overruled this decision, directing the investigation officer to present the FIR and related documents to the magistrate, who would then decide the bail matters.

This inquiry began on October 18, 2024, after a complaint was filed regarding the leak of the MDCAT paper, which had occurred on September 22, 2024. The FIA discovered that Dow University of Health Sciences DUHS officials and others had breached confidentiality and used social media to sell the leaked information during the exam preparation stage. As a result, several individuals have been booked under various sections of PECA and the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
